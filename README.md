# ZeroZenZero
> An AI-powered pipeline for reproducible science and poetic storytelling.
> "ZeroZenZero aims to make scientific analysis as reproducible as poetry—anyone, anywhere, anytime."

## 🌱 Project Philosophy
ZeroZenZero aims to blend scientific reproducibility with intuitive, poetic narrative.  
Every output can be regenerated and verified by both humans and AI agents.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce
1. `git clone ...`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.example`)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run analysis:  
    - `python scripts/analyze_ndvi.py`
    - `python scripts/eval_accuracy.py`
    - `python scripts/generate_report.py`
5. Check `/results/writeup.md`

## 📁 Directory Structure
- `data/raw/` — Input data (NDVI, GeoTIFF, ground truth, etc)
- `data/processed/` — Processed/intermediate data
- `scripts/` — Main processing and evaluation scripts
- `results/` — Generated writeups and visualizations

## 🚩 Project Progress

- [2025-08-03] 🚀 Initial pipeline published!
    - Dummy NDVI GeoTIFF generator: **Anyone can reproduce the project from zero.**
    - NDVI analysis script: **Automatic calculation & PNG visualization.**
    - Results are output to `/results/` for full transparency and traceability.
- Codebase now ready for:
    - Automated benchmarking and agent-driven evaluation
    - Markdown/LaTeX writeup generation
    - Integration with LLM agents or external AI pipelines

**All steps are reproducible from a fresh clone. Just follow the README below!**

> *Next: Anomaly detection, ground truth benchmarking, and full agent automation.*
